# Sensor_Data_Classification
Given 5 datasets, each containing hourly sensor data (00h to 23h) from a manufacturing tool (A, B, C, D, E). Each csv file contains data for one tool, inside the csv file one row represents one time series sample. The objective is to build a model to determine any given time series sample is from which tool.
